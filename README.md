Bouncing-Boxes
==============

A C++ program that uses SDL and OpenGL to create bouncing boxes based on music.

##Required Libraries
* [SDL][1]
* [un4seen BASS][2]

##Release Notes
At the moment, the program does not accept command-line arguments, so you must place the song you want to play
in the same directory and name it "test1.mp3". Command-line arguments will be added soon.
